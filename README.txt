Editor Macros (Emacs)
=====================
Some random ELisp programs I wrote to supplement my ever-so-harder schoolwork, plus my emacs config

FILES
cgen.el - Christian's Generator; functions that generate strings in buffers
	- cgen-random-multiple-choice-questions - Generates random multiple choice answers based on a string of inputs (ex. "ABCD" will generate A, B, C & D randomly, along with numbers)
	- cgen-numbered-list - literally the same thing as numl

num-l.el - Numbered List; houses one function that makes a random list (my first elisp program btw)
	- numl - generates a random list based on parameters that the user inputs

.emacs - a configuration that barely makes use of packages
